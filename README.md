## General Information
- After our team agreed upon a design goal for our project, namely, a storefront, the next question was, what would our store sell?
- While multiple ideas were discussed, the idea of a traditionally low tech yet iconic store, the fantasy shop, combined with modern front-end technology, was an appealing one.
- Fantasy was a shared passion between many team members, which allowed for us to easily throw ourselves into the work and have a clear goal.
